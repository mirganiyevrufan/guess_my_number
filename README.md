# guess_my_number

The goal of this project is to guess the secret number which is between 1 and 20.
User starts with score 20. After each failed guess score decreases by 1. When user finds the correct number, screen turns green and "Highscore" keeps the score for the next game. If user wants to play it again clicks "Again!" button and it all resets everything except the "Highscore"

Functions to be used:

1. Math.random() : The random() function is used to generate a random number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive). This generated number is then multiplied with 20 and added 1 to generate numbers from 1 â€“ 20.

3. Math.trunc() :  Math.trunc() function returns the integer part of a number by removing any fractional digits.
